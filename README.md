# Emacs config
My new, cozier emacs config. Gone are the days of `vi` keybindings, here are the days of endless emacs keychords! 

## How to Install

If you have an existing `.emacs.d` directory back it up. 

```bash
$ mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.backup
```

Now clone this repo (making sure to save it to a new `.emacs.d` directory)! 

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:eli-oat/pillow-fort.org.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Launch emacs! SUCCESS!
